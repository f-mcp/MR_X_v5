WEBSITE 


- Pop up that appears when entered in text input and shift/caps lock is on saying "answers are not case sensitive"

- Map inlay (good idea or no?)

- user login (chatGPT hist)

- hash encryption for above

- figure out how to italicise within the question logs
    This is done, apart from the '3'. These are loaded as the loop index, not actually contained in question_store

- change q4 clue to be doable for people who didnt go bearded theory

- change css elements within the html pages to separately loaded in so they're not described every time in each file

- hints flex boxes - align them rowwise, but let them expand in the x so that they get wider and wrap around. 

- flow chart that uncovers sections as you progress?

- Maybe put in a notes section (parallel column to clues?) that you can freehand write in and drag around given info/pictures
    - Also: That you can drag and resize horizontally, so that it can be completely hidden to the right, or enlarged to (nearly?) the whole page

GAME


- change incorrect clue on q3 to include 'island'? it still wouldnt be gettable without previous info so can't hurt for clarity

- q11 nop longer works due to missing deer sign on lewis and harris. Ideally need a new deer sign in scotland to use

- fix reddit link to megastorer or just insert the image 

Our mountaintop scientist travels Northwest out of his birth city. 
On his journey he:
 crosses the fourth of three bridges,
 passes the eleventh lake that has no head,
 skirts around the most remote city in the world, continuing North,
 passes the battleground that marked the end of the Napoleonic wars,
 passes the muddled up chirpy lot
 follows Garry until he can go no further.


 - Maybe try it where clues are only revealed once you have the correct information. This Would allow for subsequent clues to be a bit less cryptic
    in the pursuit of disguising information. It would also hide the What3words info until the last steps when it becomes needed.
    Worth revising clues if so to ensure good clarity.
