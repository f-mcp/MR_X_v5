WEBSITE 


/- Pop up that appears when entered in text input and shift/caps lock is on saying "answers are not case sensitive" not needed

/- Map inlay (good idea or no?) too limited

- user login (chatGPT hist)

- hash encryption for above

/- figure out how to italicise within the question logs
/    This is done, apart from the '3'. These are loaded as the loop index, not actually contained in question_store

/- change q4 clue to be doable for people who didnt go bearded theory

- change css elements within the html pages to separately loaded in so they're not described every time in each file
     Actually, a better way is to have page specific css (like notepad related stuff for clue.html) in the html file
     the rest can be in styles. It keeps unnecessary parsing to a min
     If we find there's a lot of css in any particular html file, we can always create another 'styles' specific to that question

- hints flex boxes - align them rowwise, but let them expand in the x so that they get wider and wrap around. 

/- flow chart that uncovers sections as you progress? nope

- Maybe put in a notes section (parallel column to clues?) that you can freehand write in and drag around given info/pictures
    - Also: That you can drag and resize horizontally, so that it can be completely hidden to the right, or enlarged to (nearly?) the whole page
    done, though still could do with some tweaking
    (outstanding bugs: can't clear text boxes, colors aren't saved on refresh, no notepad info is saved on form submit)
    It'd also be good to be able to have any given images in this section


GAME

- check emojikey fits all the clues - jonah said it didn't work for youtube link?

- change incorrect clue on q3 to include 'island'? it still wouldnt be gettable without previous info so can't hurt for clarity

- q11 no longer works due to missing deer sign on lewis and harris. Ideally need a new deer sign in scotland to use

- fix reddit link to megastorer or just insert the image 

Our mountaintop scientist travels Northwest out of his birth city. 
On his journey he:
 travels forth on the second syllable of his second university,
 passes the lake eleven that has no head,
 passes the most remote of cities, continuing North,
 passes the battleground that marked the end of the Napoleonic wars,
 passes the muddled up chirpy lot
 follows Garry until he can go no further.
When the two roads converge once more, he starts counting the metal men on his right, up to his house number as a baby.
Then he looks to his left for a sign.
You'll need two more signs to lead you to an airport in which city?

he starts counting the metal men that carry what he worked on so much.
1, 2, 3, 4... up to his house number as a baby. Then, he looks to his left for a sign.
You'll need two others to lead you to an airport in which city?


 - Maybe try it where clues are only revealed once you have the correct information. This Would allow for subsequent clues to be a bit less cryptic
    in the pursuit of disguising information. It would also hide the What3words info until the last steps when it becomes needed.
    Worth revising clues if so to ensure good clarity.
