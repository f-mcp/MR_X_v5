        <h1>Greetings Agents</h1>
        <p><br>I'll get straight to the point, we desperately need your help.<br><br>

            The elusive Mr X is causing trouble once again, and I trust I don't need
            to remind you how dangerous he can be. We need to lock him up once and for
            all. Find him. Complete this mission by <b>telling me his name.</b><br><br>

            The good news is we've picked up on his virtual paper trail. Unfortunately,
            it's highly cryptic and we need the best-of-the-best in code crackers to
            track him down, hence why we've come to you.<br><br>

            It is believed that he is operating with his three henchman. Mr X is too
            much of a sneaky fucker to catch him alone, so our plan is to pin down these
            three and use the informaton we get from them to find Mr X once and for all.<br><br>

            The clues they've left behind are shown within this document. As you know,
            each requires an input to display vital information for following clues.<br><br>

            When you close in on the henchmen, we have discriptions of their appearance
            to confirm their identities. These can be found below this brief. Finally,
            we also found a confusing cipher key left behind by the henchman, see if
            comes in handy. Find it below the henchmen descriptions.<br><br>

            Best of luck agents, the country's security rests in your hands.<br><br>

            Happy hunting,<br><br><br>
        </p>
